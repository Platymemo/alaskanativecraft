# Alaska Native Craft

## About

This mod aims to bring various aspects of Alaska Native cultures to Minecraft!\
Currently included features are described below.

## Features

1. Mobs
    * Seals
        * These fellas spawn in ocean and river biomes and spend their time hunting fish
    * Ptarmigans
        * These guys can be tamed with seeds and rides your shoulder much like a parrot!
    * Moose
        * Moose are the largest members of the deer family and can be found occasionally wandering the colder biomes.\
          If you've got a good eye, you may even track them down by following the trail of stripped logs they leave in
          their wake!
2. Dogsleds
    * Dogsleds are the best way to travel across the frozen tundra. Just harness up your favorite dog and get to
      mushing!
    * A good thing to pay attention to is that dogsleds are much faster on snow and ice.
3. Harpoons
    * Tired of having to run up to mobs to leash them? Or maybe you just don't want to have to grind for that pesky
      trident. If so, this product's for you!
4. Kuspuks
    * These traditional Alaska Native clothes are both stylish and comfortable. These outfits are here for decoration
      purposes only (for now).
5. Ulu
    * These guys are great for everything shears are good for, but they don't fill your inventory with leaf blocks.
    * More importantly, they're great for cutting fish into little strips for drying on the drying rack!
6. Berries!
    * Enjoy the taste of blueberries, raspberries, and salmonberries! These berry bushes can only spawn in
      snowy and taiga biomes.
7. Akutaq
    * If berries aren't enough to sate your sweet tooth, how about delicious akutaq? Mix some raw venison or fish with
      berries in a bowl to make some! In addition, akutaq will provide some nice random benefits for a short time
      depending on how many berries you add!
8. Dry Fish
    * A beloved snack by all, dry fish is simply strips of fish that have been left out in the sun to dry. While it
      won't fill your stomach, it will get you through the day.
9. Driftwood
    * Driftwood naturally washes ashore on beaches across the world. Perhaps you can fashion a drying rack from them?
10. Snow Goggles
    * Like being able to see the whole screen? No? then wear some nice snow goggles! These were originally invented by
      native peoples to prevent snow blindness, and now you can wear them in Minecraft too!
    * These guys are pretty rare though, spawning only in taiga and snowy village chests!
